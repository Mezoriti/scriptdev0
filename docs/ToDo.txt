--- TO DO ---
Simple list of things we need to do.

--- ScriptDev0 Framework ---
Move all text out of C++ code and into SD0 database.

--- Scripting with Priorities ---
1) Boss AI and Boss Event scripts
2) Specific NPC AI, Gossip, Quest, Event scripts
3) Spell and Item scripts

--- Core Problems ---

- Spell scripts are only scriptable within the core. Spell scripts should be done in SD0 since they are very specialized.
